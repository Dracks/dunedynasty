Hi there, to generate a flatpak for your Linux application using a Makefile, you can follow these steps:

    Install the Flatpak tool: sudo apt install flatpak

    Create a manifest file (.flatpak-builder) for your application, which specifies the application's metadata, dependencies, and build instructions. Here's an example:

name: com.example.myapp
runtime: org.freedesktop.Platform.GLib
modules:
  - name: myapp
    buildsystem: simple
    build-commands:
      - make
      - make install
    sources:
      - Makefile
      - src/

    Create a build script that will generate the flatpak. Here's an example:

#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Build the application
make

# Create the flatpak bundle
flatpak-builder --user-sourced --force-clean --ccache --build-dir=build com.example.myapp.flatpak com.example.myapp

# Install the flatpak bundle
flatpak install com.example.myapp.flatpak

    Run the build script: ./build-flatpak.sh, this will build the flatpak bundle and install it in your system.

    Run your flatpak application: flatpak run com.example.myapp

For more detailed information, you can refer to the Flatpak documentation: https://flatpak.org/
